Python-based program that generates a complete graph from randomly generated points in a 2D plane and finds its Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Prim's algorithm
	
# What I Learned!

* Data Visualization with Matplotlib: Improved my skills in graphically representing nodes, edges, and results.
* Efficient Data Structures: Used sets and lists effectively to track visited and unvisited nodes.
